## What is Ginjou?

Ginjou is a headless, framework-agnostic, progressive library for building admin panels, dashboards, and other data-intensive applications. It is inspired by [refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) and [react-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin)

## Features

*   **Framework-Agnostic:** Use it with Vue, Nuxt, or bring your own framework.
*   **Any Backend:** Connect to any backend with ease. Pre-built providers for REST APIs, Supabase, and Directus are available.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Manage user sessions and control access to resources.
*   **Realtime Streaming:** Automatically update state when content changes.
